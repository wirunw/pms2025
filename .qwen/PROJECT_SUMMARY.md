# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix and enhance the dashboard functionality in a Pharmacy Management System (PMS) application that uses SQLite as its backend database, ensuring all dashboard metrics, charts, and data tables are properly populated and displayed.

## Key Knowledge
- The application has two versions: a Google Sheets backend version (`index.html`) and a SQLite backend version (`index_sqlite.html`)
- Server runs on Node.js with Express, using SQLite database via the `db.js` file
- Uses JWT for authentication and has role-based access (user/admin)
- Dashboard API endpoint exists at `/api/dashboard/:period` (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- The dashboard includes key metrics (total sales, transactions, members, low stock), charts, and detailed tables
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling with Thai language interface
- Authentication required for most API endpoints with token stored in localStorage

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed both versions of the dashboard code to identify discrepancies
- Identified that the dashboard function in `index_sqlite.html` was not populating all dashboard elements properly
- Found the dashboard API in `server.js` already exists and returns necessary data
- Discovered that the JavaScript `loadDashboard` function was only updating list-style elements but not the additional metrics and table elements
- Located all HTML elements that need to be populated: `dashboard-total-transactions`, `dashboard-total-members`, `dashboard-low-stock-count`, charts containers, and dashboard tables
- Realized the dashboard function needs enhancement to populate all UI elements and render charts

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze dashboard implementation in SQLite version to identify current issues
2. [DONE] Compare with the original dashboard implementation to find missing features  
3. [IN PROGRESS] Fix dashboard data loading and display issues
4. [TODO] Implement missing dashboard charts and metrics
5. [TODO] Update dashboard API calls to work with SQLite backend
6. [TODO] Test dashboard functionality after fixes
